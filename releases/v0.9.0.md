## What's New

- **Pattern Match File Filters** ([#19](https://github.com/gregeva/logtimeline/issues/19)): Specify filter patterns via files instead of command line arguments using `--include-file`, `--exclude-file`, and `--highlight-file`. Supports multiple files per filter type, comments (`#`), and literal string matching. Includes a `--verbose` flag to display merged regex patterns for debugging.

- **Duration Unit Override** ([#17](https://github.com/gregeva/logtimeline/issues/17)): New `--duration-unit` / `-du` option to manually specify input duration units (ns, us, ms, s). Essential for logs from servers using non-millisecond units like Apache HTTP Server (microseconds) or Nginx (seconds).

- **Adaptive Duration Unit Length**: Duration column width now adapts based on available terminal space, improving readability on narrow terminals.

- **Navigate Pattern File**: Added `patterns/navigate-app-calls` pattern file for filtering Windchill Navigate application traffic from access logs.

## Bug Fixes

- **Windows Terminal Detection**: Skip OSC 11 terminal background auto-detection on Windows since it uses Unix-only commands. Windows users should use `-lbg` flag explicitly for light background terminals.

- **Statistics Duration/Count Mismatch**: Fixed issue where statistics calculations used wrong count when log entries lacked duration data.

- **Heatmap Dark Background Gradients**: Updated heatmap color gradients to use 8-level scales that are visible on dark terminals. Removed near-black gray colors (233, 234) that were invisible on many terminals.

## Known Issues

- **Tomcat %D Directive Unit Ambiguity**: The `%D` access log directive uses milliseconds in Tomcat 6-9 but microseconds in Tomcat 10.1+. Since ltl cannot auto-detect the Tomcat version, users analyzing Tomcat 10.1+ logs must use `-du us` to specify microsecond input. Tomcat 9 and earlier logs work correctly with the default millisecond assumption.
