## What's New

- Progress indicator now shows rolling average lines/sec throughput metric

## Bug Fixes

- #31: Progress indicator now works correctly when processing many small log files (under 1000 lines each). Previously, no progress was shown for files smaller than 997 lines. Progress is now based on total lines read across all files, with updates every ~5000 lines.
- #29: CSV output filenames no longer fail when using long regex patterns with `-include`, `-exclude`, or `-highlight`. Long arguments are now truncated to 30 characters each, and total filename length is capped at 200 characters for cross-platform compatibility.

## Breaking Changes

None

## Upgrade Notes

No special steps required.

## Performance Notes

- Progress indicator update frequency reduced from every 997 lines to every 4999 lines, resulting in ~1% performance improvement on large files due to reduced I/O overhead.
