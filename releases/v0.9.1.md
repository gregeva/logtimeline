## What's New

- Progress indicator now shows rolling average lines/sec throughput metric

## Bug Fixes

- #31: Progress indicator now works correctly when processing many small log files (under 1000 lines each). Previously, no progress was shown for files smaller than 997 lines. Progress is now based on total lines read across all files, with updates every ~5000 lines.
- #29: CSV output filenames no longer fail when using long regex patterns with `-include`, `-exclude`, or `-highlight`. Long arguments are now truncated to 30 characters each, and total filename length is capped at 200 characters for cross-platform compatibility.
- #32: Fixed display issues on narrow terminals:
  - Summary table heading text now wraps on word boundaries instead of breaking layout
  - Long filenames in summary table are shortened with `...` in the middle (preserving start and end)
  - Progress indicator ("Processing line X in file...") now strips path and shortens filename to prevent line wrapping
- #28: Fixed CSV output issues:
  - Heatmap mode (`-hm`) no longer includes empty latency statistics columns in CSV output
  - `totalOccurrences` field now correctly populated when using `-ov` (omit-values)

## Breaking Changes

None

## Upgrade Notes

No special steps required.

## Performance Notes

- Progress indicator update frequency reduced from every 997 lines to every 4999 lines, resulting in ~1% performance improvement on large files due to reduced I/O overhead.
- Heatmap mode now uses ~12% less memory and ~3% less time by not collecting individual duration values for percentile calculation (which are not used when heatmap is displayed).
